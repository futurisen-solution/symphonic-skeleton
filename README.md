## Architecture

### [Domain-Driven Design](https://github.com/ZilvinasKucinskas/FRP-EventSourcing/blob/master/sources/xx735.Eric.Evans.Domaindriven.Design.Tackling.Complexity.in.the.Heart.of.Software.pdf)

DDD proposes a Layered Architecture as a way to separate concerns and avoid responsibility confusion by splitting the codebase in 4 main layers: **User Interface**, **Application**, **Domain**, and **Infrastructure**.

The main rule here is that components in each layer should depend only on components in the same layer or any layer beneath it. Upper layers can use components of lower ones just by calling their public interfaces and lower layers can only communicate upwards by Inversion of Control (IoC).

- **User Interface Layer**: is responsible for displaying data and capturing userâ€™s commands. (Views, Controllers, CLI, etc.)
- **Application Layer**: serves as an orchestrator of domain work, it does not know domain rules, but organizes and delegates domain objects to do their job. It is also the only layer accessible to other bounded contexts. (Commands, Command Handlers, etc.)
- **Domain Layer**: holds the business logic and rules, as well as the business state. It is where the Domain Model lives. (Interfaces, Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Services, etc.)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: implements all the technical functionalities the application needs to support the higher layers, persistence, messaging, communication between layers, etc... (Repositories, Caching, External Integrations, etc.)

Even though not all layers are required in every system, the existence of the Domain Layer is a prerequisite in DDD.
